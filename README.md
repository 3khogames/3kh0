What Are Unblocked Games?
<br>
Unblocked games are web-based games that can be played on computers or mobile devices without the need for downloading or installation. They are called "unblocked" because they are specifically designed to bypass web filters and firewall restrictions often imposed in educational institutions and workplaces. These games provide a welcome escape during breaks or downtime, allowing players to relax and unwind.
